My personal Hammerspoon config

* `Spoons/Chains.spoon`: bind a single keybinding to perform multiple actions in sequence as described in a table. Chains.link replicates chain keybindings from [Spectacle](https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle) and [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate). Chains.op can cycle through anonymous functions in sequence.
* `screens.lua`: includes DDC/CI input changing through [m1ddc](https://github.com/waydabber/m1ddc) (previously [ddcctl](https://github.com/kfix/ddcctl)) and shell scripts located in `bin/`
* `urls.lua`: handle URLs opened from non-browser applications. replicates functionality from [finicky](https://github.com/johnste/finicky)
