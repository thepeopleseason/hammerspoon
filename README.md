My personal Hammerspoon config

* `chains.lua`: replicates chain keybindings from [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) using a table and iterators
* `screens.lua`: includes DDC/CI input changing through [m1ddc](https://github.com/waydabber/m1ddc) (previously [ddcctl](https://github.com/kfix/ddcctl)) and shell scripts located in `bin/`
